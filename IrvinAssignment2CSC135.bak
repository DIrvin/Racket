; A: Fracktorial
;Factorial function for even numbers
(define (fracktorial x)
  ; if X is less than 2 it can only be 1 or 0. which is only 1 fracktorial wise
  (if (< x 2) 1
      ; we know that even numbers have no remainder. so if there is no
      ; remainder the value of x must be even. So we multiply the value and 
      ; jump to the next even value
          (if (= 0 (modulo x 2)) (* x (fracktorial (- x 2)))
              ; else the value must be odd, we get the next even value and add it.  
              (* (- x 1) (fracktorial(- x 2))))))
